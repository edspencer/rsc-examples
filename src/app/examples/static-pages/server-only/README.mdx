If you don't need interactivity (beyond what HTML gives you) in the things you render, you can probably render your entire UI on the server.

In next.js, any component that isn't labeled `'use client'` is a server component by default, so as long as your layout.tsx, page.tsx and component/XYZ.tsx are not declaring `'use client'`, your entire UI will be rendered on the server:

```layout.tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js',
  description: 'Generated by Next.js',
}

//this is a synchronous server component
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}

```

Our `page.tsx` is declared `async` in this case so that we can load data via `await`, but it could be a synchronous function too:

```page.tsx
import MyComponent from './component'
import { loadProductData } from './data'

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await loadProductData()

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My RSC-powered store</h1>
      <h2>{data.name}</h2>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  )
}

```

Here's what the fake database call looks like:

```data.tsx
// Simulates fetching product data from a database/API
export async function loadProductData(
  delay = 20,
): Promise<{ name: string; price: number; description: string }> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve({
        name: 'Product Name',
        price: 100,
        description: 'This is a product description',
      })
    }, delay)
  })
}
```

This is the other sub-component that we render inside Page - obviously you can compose together as many components as you like. If none of them us `'use client'`, the whole thing will be rendered on the server.

```component.tsx
export default function MyComponent() {
  return <p>This is MyComponent, which renders on the server</p>
}

```
