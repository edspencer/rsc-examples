This example demonstrates how to use an explicit error boundary to catch errors thrown by a server component. The process is very much the same as with client components, with the only difference being that the error boundary is a server component itself.

This example uses the simple [react-error-boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) library to create the error boundary. It's pretty easy to [roll your own](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) if you prefer.

Here's the code:

```page.tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary'

export default function PageWithBoundary() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        This page demonstrates what happens when an error is thrown in a
        component with an explicit error boundary.
      </p>

      <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorFallback />}>
        <ErrorComponent />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </>
  )
}

function ErrorComponent() {
  throw new Error('Error thrown in component')

  return 'This will never be rendered'
}

function ErrorFallback() {
  return (
    <div className="text-red-700">There was an error with this content</div>
  )
}
```

That's it! The `ErrorBoundary` component will catch any errors thrown by its children and render the `fallback` component instead. This is a much better user experience than the default behavior, which is to render either and error or nothing at all.

Here's how that looks:
