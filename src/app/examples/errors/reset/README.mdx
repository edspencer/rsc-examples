If a component on our page throws an error that we catch in an error boundary, it can be useful to offer the user a way to retry that component without hitting refresh in their browser. This is possible by using a combination of

Here's a Page that has a child component that throws an error 50% of the time.

```page.tsx
export default function ResettablePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        This page has a 50% chance of throwing an error. If it does, a Reset
        button will appear that you can click to reset the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is useful for when you want to give the user a way to recover from
        an error without having to refresh the entire page. Refresh the page a
        few times if you don't get the error immediately.
      </p>
      <ErrorComponent />
    </>
  )
}

async function ErrorComponent() {
  // Simulate a delay so we can see the Reset button spinning
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))

  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    throw new Error('Error thrown in component')
  }

  return (
    <p className="border border-blue-700 p-4">
      This has a 50% chance of throwing an error
    </p>
  )
}
```

If that error is thrown, our `error.tsx` fallback will be rendered. This fallback includes a Reset button that will reset the page when clicked. That process is handled by the `retry` function, which calls `router.refresh()` to reset the page.

While the page is being reset, we show a spinner to indicate that the page is loading. This spinner is a simple component that we've created called `Spinner`. This complicates the example a little, but is useful UX to show your user that something is happening, especially if the component that errored is a heavy or slow-loading one.

```error.tsx
'use client'

import { startTransition, useState } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

import Spinner from './Spinner'

export default function ErrorMessage({ reset }: { reset: () => void }) {
  const router = useRouter()

  const [isResetting, setIsResetting] = useState(false)

  function retry() {
    setIsResetting(true)

    startTransition(() => {
      router.refresh()
      reset()
      setIsResetting(false)
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p className="text-orange-700">
        There was an error with this page, caught by error.tsx so we can show
        this custom message.
      </p>
      <button
        onClick={() => retry()}
        disabled={isResetting}
        className="inline-flex items-center gap-4 rounded-md border bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-blue-600"
      >
        {isResetting ? <Spinner /> : null}
        Retry
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

```

Our `error.tsx` component receives a reset function as a prop, which is passed in automatically by next.js. However, calling `reset()` will not reset the page. Instead, we need to call `router.refresh()` to reset the page. We also wrap this in a `startTransition` to ensure that the page doesn't flicker when we reset it.

<Callout type="warning">
  The `reset()` function does not actually reset the component, or the page,
  just the state of the error boundary. To retry the render, you need to call
  `router.refresh()`.
</Callout>

The call to `router.refresh()` will cause the entire page to re-render, so it's not as surgical as simply reloading a single component. However, it's a good way to give the user a way to recover from an error without having to refresh the entire page. To the user it will look like the component is being reloaded, which is often good enough.

Because `router.refresh()` works asynchronously (we're going over the network to re-render on the server, after all), but does not return a Promise, we can't use `async/await` syntax here. Thankfully, we can wrap that call in a `startTransition`, which will automatically have React update the UI once the new RSC payload is received.
