This example shows how to use the built-in `loading.tsx` convention of next.js to take advantage of automatic full-page Suspense boundary created when this file is present.

As before we have a `slowDataLoad()` function that simulates a database call that takes 3 seconds to return.

```app/page.tsx
//this just simulates a database call or similar that takes 2 seconds
async function slowDataLoad(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('This data took 2 seconds to load')
    }, 2000)
  })
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await slowDataLoad()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>RSC - async Page with no Suspense</h1>
      <p>{data}</p>
      <p>
        Suspense was not used at all, so you had to wait 2 seconds to see even a
        single pixel rendered in this example.
      </p>
    </>
  )
}
```

In this case we'll just define a `loading.tsx` file in the same directory as our `page.tsx`. Next.js will automatically use whatever React Component is exported as default from `loading.tsx` as the `fallback` in a `<Suspense>` boundary that next.js automatically wraps around the component exported from `page.tsx`:

```app/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
  return (
    <div>
      Loading... (this is the content of `loading.tsx`, being shown for about 3
      seconds before the data loads and this gets replaced)
    </div>
  )
}
```

Under the covers, the presence of the `loading.tsx` file basically makes your Page work a bit more like this, with a Suspense boundary injected as a wrapper around your own Component:

```app/page-wrapper.tsx
import Loading from './loading'
import Page from './page'

export default async function SuspendablePage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={Loading}>
      <Page />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

For this reason, in the live demo for this example, you will see the loading message appear instantly, and then be swapped out 3 seconds later when `slowDataLoad()` resolves.
