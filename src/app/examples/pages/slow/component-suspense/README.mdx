<Callout type="note">
  This example was originally created as one of several examples I wrote for a
  post about [async React Server
  Components](https://edspencer.net/2024/6/18/understanding-react-server-components-and-suspense).
  See that post for a more detailed explanation of the concepts here.
</Callout>

In this example, we use Component-level opt-in `<Suspense>` boundaries to instantly render the various parts of the UI as soon as they are ready.

Here we have a bunch of UI that can be rendered immediately (all the static stuff), and then a single component called `DataComponent` that has a 3 second fetch call.

Because we wrapped that in a `<Suspense>` boundary, next.js is able to instantly render and deliver to the browser all of that rendered HTML, leave a `<Suspense>` placeholder in the response, then when the sub-Component finally renders, stream the new content directly to the browser as part of the same http request:

```app/page.tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import Loading from '@/components/Loading'

async function slowDataLoad(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('This data took 3 seconds to load')
    }, 3000)
  })
}

//we placed a <Suspense> boundary around our <DataComponent />
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>RSC - async Page with Component-level Suspense</h1>
      <p>
        This paragraph was rendered instantly by the server. Underneath it is a
        Suspense component, which loads data that takes 3 seconds to fetch:
      </p>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <DataComponent />
      </Suspense>
      <p>
        This example renders 2 async components - the Page component and the
        child DataComponent. The DataComponent loads data that takes 3 seconds
        to load, but because we wrapped it inside Suspense, the page-level
        component did not have anything else to wait around for (despite being
        declared `async`), so it rendered immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the async Page component rendered, the Suspense fallback was shown
        for 3 seconds until DataComponent resolved its data, at which point the
        new content was streamed to the browser.
      </p>
    </>
  )
}

async function DataComponent() {
  const data = await slowDataLoad()

  return <p>{data}</p>
}
```

`<Suspense>` boundaries with React Server Components allow you to trivially slice up your application at almost any level in the React component tree, and have each slice load in the instant it's available, without blocking other parts of the UI from loading.
