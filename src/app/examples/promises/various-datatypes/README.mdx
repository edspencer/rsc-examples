This example shows how we can stream various types of data to the client using Promises. Shown here are:

- strings
- integers/floats
- plain JSON objects
- arrays
- rendered React Components

This example is slightly more advanced in that it has a custom `<SuspenseWrapper />` component to avoid repeated code - take a look at the other Promise-based examples if this is confusing. Basically it's still just `<Suspense>` boundaries wrapping client components, passing in a Promise each time. The `getData` function just makes it easy for the example to return different types of data.

```page.tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import ClientPromise from '@/components/examples/ClientPromise'
import ClientPortal from '@/components/examples/ClientPortal'

async function getData(value: any, delay: number): Promise<any> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(value)
    }, delay)
  })
}

export default function SuspensePage() {
  return (
    <div className="mx-4 my-4 flex flex-col gap-4">
      <h1 className="text-3xl">Server Component Promises</h1>
      <p>This line rendered on the server. Below this, values will stream in</p>
      <p>Now here's a Promise that resolved to a string:</p>
      <SuspenseWrapper value={'some string'} delay={1000} />

      <p>Now here's a Promise that resolved to an integer:</p>
      <SuspenseWrapper value={12345} delay={2000} />

      <p>Now here's a Promise that resolved to a float:</p>
      <SuspenseWrapper value={123.45} delay={3000} />

      <p>Now here's a Promise that resolved to an object:</p>
      <SuspenseWrapper value={{ myKey: 'someValue' }} delay={4000} />

      <p>
        Now here's a Promise that resolved to an array (of acceptable elements):
      </p>
      <SuspenseWrapper
        value={['some string', 12345, 123.45, { myKey: 'someValue' }]}
        delay={5000}
      />

      <p>Server-rendered Component:</p>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <ClientPortal childrenPromise={renderHeavyComponent(6000)} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  )
}

function renderHeavyComponent(delay: number): Promise<React.ReactNode> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(<ServerChildComponent data={{ some: 'data' }} />)
    }, delay)
  })
}

function ServerChildComponent({ data }: { data: any }) {
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>
}

function SuspenseWrapper({ value, delay }: { value: any; delay: number }) {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <ClientPromise dataPromise={getData(value, delay)} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

## Explanation

The example uses its `getData` function to simulate the fetching of different types of data with different delays. `<SuspenseWrapper>` is a trivial custom component that wraps `<ClientPromise>` in a `<Suspense>` boundary, passing in the Promise returned by `getData`. It's important to keep those `<Suspense>` boundaries in the server component templates, not in client components.

`ClientPromise` is a trivial client-side component that just renders the contents of a resolved Promise into a `<div>` or `<pre>` tag, depending on the type of the resolved value. We render a red border around it in the example to make it clear where the client component is.

```ClientPromise.tsx
'use client'
import { use } from 'react'

export default function ClientPromise({ dataPromise}: {
  dataPromise: Promise<string>
}) {
  const data = use(dataPromise)

  if (typeof data === 'object') {
    return (
      <pre className="border border-red-600">
        {JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
      </pre>
    )
  }

  return <div className="border border-red-600">{data}</div>
}
```

The final example shows us returning a rendered React Component (or Component tree) from a Promise. This is a powerful feature of React Server Components, as it allows us to return complex client-side components from server components. In this case, we're just returning a simple `<ServerChildComponent>` with some data.

This one is just a `<ClientPortal>` wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary. ClientPortal is a trivial client component that expects a `childrenPromise` prop, which is a Promise that resolves to a ReactNode. It uses the `use` hook to get the resolved value and render it, wrapping it in a blue border this time to show it's inside a client component.

```ClientPortal.tsx
'use client'
import { use } from 'react'

export default function ClientPortal({childrenPromise}: {
  childrenPromise: Promise<React.ReactNode>
}) {
  const children = use(childrenPromise)

  return <div className="border border-blue-600">{children}</div>
}
```

The Portal component here is purely to show that a React component can be returned from a Promise and rendered on the client, which may be helpful in some cases, but `<Suspense>` already handles this for you in most cases:

```amended-page.tsx
      <p>Server-rendered Component:</p>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>

        //You don't need a ClientPortal here, just use the Suspense boundary
        <ServerChildComponent delay={6000}>
      </Suspense>
```
