What happens when a Promise sent from server to client is rejected? This example shows a promise that is rejected on the server, and how the client handles that rejection.

```page.tsx
import { LoadingMessage } from '@/components/LoadingMessage'

import { Suspense } from 'react'
import Table from '@/components/examples/table'

async function getData(delay: number) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, delay))
}

export default function RejectedPromisePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>This page was rendered on the server.</p>
      <p>
        It wants to show a data table below, but the data is rejected. The table
        component is wrapped in a Suspense component, which will show a loading
        message until the data is ready. In this case, the data will never be
        ready, so the loading message will stay on the screen
      </p>

      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingMessage />}>
        <Table dataPromise={getData(1000)} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}
```

What happens here? The `getData` function returns a Promise that is rejected after a delay. There's no error handling in this example, so what happens is that we'll see an error message in our server logs, and the client will show the loading message indefinitely.
