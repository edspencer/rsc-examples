This example demonstrates the behavior of a React page when an error is thrown in a component without an error boundary to catch it. The `NoHandling` component includes an `ErrorComponent` that intentionally throws an error. When this occurs, the error propagates up to the nearest error boundary, which in this case is the root of the application. The output differs between development and production modes, affecting the overall user experience negatively. The example suggests improving error handling by implementing either an explicit error boundary or using a dedicated error handling component.
