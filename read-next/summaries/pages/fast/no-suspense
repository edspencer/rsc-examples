This example demonstrates the use of React Server Components without employing `<Suspense>` boundaries or a `loading.tsx` file. It illustrates a scenario where data is fetched from a simulated fast database, which returns results in approximately 20 milliseconds. The code defines an asynchronous function, `slowDataLoad`, that mimics a database call and resolves after a short delay. The main component, `Page`, awaits this data and renders it alongside a header and a note about the absence of `<Suspense>`. The key takeaway is that for quick data fetches, the lack of `<Suspense>` does not negatively impact performance, but developers should be cautious as slower fetches could lead to degraded user experience.
