This example illustrates the impact of slow-loading data on the interactivity of an asynchronous React Server Component (RSC). It begins by defining a function, `slowDataLoad`, which simulates a database call that takes 2 seconds to resolve. The main `Page` component then awaits this data, causing the entire page to block until the data is fully loaded. As a result, users experience a delay of 2 seconds before any content is rendered, highlighting the downside of using async/await in this context.

The example emphasizes the importance of using Suspense boundaries for data that may take longer than 10 milliseconds to load. By doing so, developers can ensure that the UI remains responsive and displays content to users without unnecessary delays. The document suggests avoiding async/await in scenarios where data fetching could significantly hinder user experience, advocating for a more efficient approach to handle slow data loads.
