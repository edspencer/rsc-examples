This example demonstrates how to use React Server Components with a focus on providing user feedback during form submissions. It highlights the use of the `useFormStatus` hook to display a loading spinner while waiting for a server response, simulating a slow server with a 3-second delay. 

The code snippet showcases a `SlowForm` component that utilizes `useFormState` to manage form submission state and display messages based on the submission status. A separate `SubmitButton` component is created to handle the loading state, as `useFormStatus` cannot be used in the same component as the form. This separation allows for reusability of the button across different forms.

Additionally, the example emphasizes the importance of implementing authentication for server actions in real-world applications, as these endpoints require careful consideration regarding security. 

Overall, this example serves as a practical guide for implementing user feedback in forms using React Server Components and managing form states effectively.
