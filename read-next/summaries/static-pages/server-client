This example demonstrates how to effectively combine server and client components using React Server Components (RSC) with Next.js. It features a server-rendered page that includes a child component, `<MicrophoneList />`, which is designated as a client component due to its need to interact with browser-specific APIs, such as accessing the microphone.

The main page component, defined in `page.tsx`, renders a header and a paragraph indicating that it is server-rendered, followed by the `<MicrophoneList />` component. 

The `<MicrophoneList />` component, located in `microphonelist.tsx`, utilizes the `'use client'` directive to indicate that it should run in the browser. It employs the `useEffect` hook to asynchronously fetch a list of available microphones using a utility function, `getMicrophones`, and stores this data in the component's state. The component then displays the list of microphones, demonstrating its capability to access the mediaDevices API.

This example highlights the seamless integration of server-rendered content with client-side interactivity, showcasing how to manage components that require different execution contexts within a Next.js application.
